PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. It is an unsupervised algorithm. There is no target variable as such and no predictions are made. It is used for dimensionality reduction and is a feature extraction technique post which the most significant features or principal componenents are identified. Principal components are found by performing orthogonal transformation of the data. Before using PCA, data has to be made unitless through standardization/normalization.
It is also used to solve the problem of multicolinearity as after PCA, correlation between any 2 principal components is always zero.
Though it is not a perfect ML algorithm, it is a popular tool used in EDA & predictive modelling.
The dataset used here is of Property Price and after PCA is completed, we can build any suitable supervised model on it. I have checked it here with Linear Regression algorithm.
